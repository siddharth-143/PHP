    # Associative array :
        /* Array with named keys

        The associative arrays are very similar to numeric arrays in term of functionality
        but they are different in terms of their index.

        Associtive array will have their index as string so that you can establish a 
        strong association between key and values.

        Don't keep associative array inside double quotes while printing otherwise it would not
        return any values in somecases..........*/
