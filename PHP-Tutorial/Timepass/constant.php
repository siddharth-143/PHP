        Constant are like variable, except that once they are define, they cannot be
        undefine or changed except magic conatant.

        Constants are very useful for storing data that doesn't change while
        the script is running.

        such as database username and password, website's base URL, company name, etc.

        Constant are define using PHP's define() function, which accepts two arguments

        The name of the constant, and its values. */
