        /* While there is only one type of comment in HTMl, PHP has two types.
        The first type we will discuss is the single line comment. The single line 
        comment tells the interpreter to ignore everything that occurs on the line on
        the right of the comment. To do a single ine comment type "//" or "#" and all 
        text to the right will be ignored by PHP interpreter. */
